# Example Site Readme

This is a really basic example that will give us everything we need to make a basic web page.

### What is a .md File?

It's a markup language, like HTML. It's called Markdown. It's used to style documents and developers love it cuz it makes writing boring stuff feel like code.

Diff symbols mean diff formatting. # symbols are like headers (# is like an h1 or main header, ## like and h2 or subheader, etc). Back ticks (`) are used to mark code stuff.

Just treat it like a text file for now.

## Contents

The root of the folder has 
- this `README` file
- an `index.html` file that's pre-filled
- a `css` folder
  - with an empty `styles.css` file
- a `js` folder
  - with an empty `scripts.js` file
- an `images` folder 
  - cheese.png
  - cheese1.png
  - cheese2.png

## How to View

Keep all the files together. Then open the `index.html` in a web browser (right-click, 'open with Safari/Chrome/Firefox').
